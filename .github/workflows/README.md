Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your React website involves several steps. Here's a simple step-by-step guide to get you started:

## Step 1: Choose Your CI/CD Tool

There are several CI/CD tools available. Popular options include:

- **GitHub Actions**
- **Travis CI**
- **CircleCI**
- **GitLab CI**

For this example, we'll use **GitHub Actions** since it's integrated with GitHub.

If you haven't already created your React app, do it using:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
